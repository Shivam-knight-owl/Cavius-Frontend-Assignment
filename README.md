# Post Management App

## Description

This is a Post Management App built using **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **React Router DOM**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to view a list of posts, search for posts dynamically based on the title, view paginated results, and see detailed information about individual posts.

The data is fetched from **JSONPlaceholder** API.

### Features:
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Dynamic Searching**: Users can search for posts based on the title using a search bar.
- **Pagination**: The home page supports pagination to display a limited number of posts at once.
- **Post Details**: Each post has a dedicated page showing detailed information about the post.
- **Skeleton Loader**: A skeleton loader is used on the homepage to show a loading animation while the posts are being fetched.

### Routes:
- `/`: The homepage that displays all posts with pagination and a search bar.
- `/post/:id`: Displays the detailed view of an individual post with its title and body.
